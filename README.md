A lib help you patch Rust instance, and easy to partial update configures.

## Introduction
A derive macro [`struct_patch::Patch`][patch-derive] helps you generate patch structure with all fields in optional,
and implement [`struct_patch::traits::Patch`][patch-trait],
such that we can partial update with `apply` method.

## Quick Example
```rust
    use struct_patch::Patch;
    use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

    #[derive(Default, Patch)]
    #[patch_derive(Debug, Default, Deserialize, Serialize)]
    struct Item {
        field_bool: bool,
        field_int: usize,
        field_string: String,
    }

    fn patch_json() {
        use struct_patch::traits::Patch;

        let mut item = Item::default();

        let data = r#"{
            "field_int": 7
        }"#;

        let patch = serde_json::from_str(data).unwrap();

        assert_eq!(
          format!("{patch:?}"),
          "ItemPatch { field_bool: None, field_int: Some(7), field_string: None }"
        );

        item.apply(patch);

        assert_eq!(item.field_bool, false);
        assert_eq!(item.field_int, 7);
        assert_eq!(item.field_string, "");
    }

```
## Attributes
Following are attributes you can easy to use patch a struct as you want
  - [`patch_derive`][patch_derive]: passing the derives to patch struct
  - [`patch_name`][patch_name]: specify the patch struct name, default name is {struct name}Patch

## Methods for original structure
The [`struct_patch::traits::Patch`][patch-trait] will implement, you can check the docs for details.
  - `apply`: apply the patch, only update the existing fields
  - `into_patch_by_diff`: diff on a previous state and get the patch instance
  - `new_empty_patch`: get an empty patch instance


## Methods for patch structure
With `status` feature, the patch struct will implement [`PatchStatus`][patch-status-trait] trait and providing following methods:
  - `is_empty`: check there is anything in the patch
